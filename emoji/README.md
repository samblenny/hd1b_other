# Emoji

## Generating the codepoint list

[codepoints.txt](codepoints.txt) is a list of the single-codepoint emoji from
Unicode 14 and is meant to work with emoji glyphs from GNU Unifont.
[codepoints.txt](codepoints.txt) was created by running the
[basic_emoji.py](basic_emoji.py) python script, which extracts a list of
Basic_Emoji codepoints from
[../unicode/emoji-sequences.txt](../unicode/emoji-sequences.txt)
