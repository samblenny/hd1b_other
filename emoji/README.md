# Emoji

## Generating the codepoint list

[basic_emoji.codepoints](basic_emoji.codepoints) is a list of the
single-codepoint emoji from Unicode 14 and is meant to work with emoji glyphs
from GNU Unifont. [basic_emoji.codepoints](basic_emoji.codepoints) was created
by running the [basic_emoji.py](basic_emoji.py) python script, which extracts a
list of Basic_Emoji codepoints from
[../unicode/emoji-sequences.txt](../unicode/emoji-sequences.txt)
