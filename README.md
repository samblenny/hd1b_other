## Legal

Unless otherwised noted, source code here for building sprite sheets is released under
the MIT license. Typefaces and font files are covered by their own copyrights and
license notices (see below). To the best of my understanding, the typefaces here are
licensed such that distributing glyph sprite sheets with an MIT licensed project is
acceptable.


## Noto Sans KR

This project uses glyphs from the Noto Sans KR typeface.
