## Legal

Unless otherwised noted, source code here for building sprite sheets is released under
the MIT license. Typefaces and font files are covered by their own copyrights and
license notices (see below). To the best of my understanding, the typefaces used here
are licensed such that distributing glyph sprite sheets with an MIT licensed project is
acceptable.


## JF Dot Izumi 16

This project uses glyphs from the JF Dot Izumi 16 Gothic bitmap font as downloaded from
http://jikasei.me/font/jf-dotfont/ in November 2021.

As I understand it, Izumi is licensed under the closest equivalent of Public
Domain that is possible under Japanese copyright law, which is a bit different
than under US copyright law.
